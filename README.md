Currently we are using wired or may be wireless mouses,In real time cases some computers may not support for a physical mouse or may some users may cannot use physical mouse, so this Hand controlled AI Virtual Mouse can be used to overcome this problem. Making a user to control the mouse by reducing the computer human interaction.

#FUNCTIONALITIES:
-> This was built using the openCV-python and mediapipe for Detecting and processing the image and mediapipe an open source cross-platform developed by google for media processing and ready-to-use ML solutions for computer vision tasks.
-> Our Hand Controlled Virtual mouse can able to move the mouse anywhere on the screen and can able to perform the click operation.
-> Our Index finger can be used to move the mouse over the screen.
-> When Our Index finger and Thumb come close to each other or touch each other then it performs the click operation.
-> And the PyautoGUI for programmatically control the mouse and keyboard.



The actual working of the mouse is based on the Hand Landmarks which can be viewed and controlled by opencv and mediapipe.

Our hand contains a total of 21 landmarks.
